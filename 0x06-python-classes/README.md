# Tasks

## My first square

Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square:

* You are not allowed to import any module

**Solution:** [0-square.py](https://github.com/monoprosito/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-python-classes/0-square.py)

```
$ amonkeyprogrammer@ubuntu:~/0x06$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
Square = __import__('0-square').Square

my_square = Square()
print(type(my_square))
print(my_square.__dict__)

$ amonkeyprogrammer@ubuntu:~/0x06$ ./0-main.py
<class '0-square.Square'>
{}
$ amonkeyprogrammer@ubuntu:~/0x06$
